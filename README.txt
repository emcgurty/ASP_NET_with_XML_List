I am also capable of programming in ASP.NET with C#.

Recently had an interview during which the fellow asked me if I understood XML and collections, eg, creating a web site without database connectivity.  So I provided him with this sample code.

Features:

Find an XML file, if not found created a new one
Load the data into a List<Class Object>
User interacts with List to add, modifiy, delete and search rows.
User may then port revised List detail to XML file

If you choose to load this sample application, please go to web.config to enter your application path.
